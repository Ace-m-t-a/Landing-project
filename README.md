# Landing-project

This is my first project where I attempt to use html and css to make an entire web page from scratch
using the skills I have learnt. I will also use git commands to ensure proper work flow is maintained.
All the html and css code has been written by myself from scratch based off previous teachings.
Emphasis is placed on arrangement of content on a webpage and basic aesthetics rather than actual
content.
